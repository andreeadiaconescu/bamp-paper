This repository contains Matlab code for modelling and analysis written by Andreea Diaconescu:

BAMP: Bayesian Models of Psychopathy (Collaboration with I. Brazil)


Getting Started
---------------

- BAMP: Run the analysis simply running `bamp_main_paper`.


Details to take into account:

- Model selection: `bamp_behav_model_evidence(options)` (Need SPM for model selection).
- Extract MAPs and test model internal validity: `bamp_extract_parameters_create_table(options)` and `bamp_plot_parameter_estimate_results(options)`.
